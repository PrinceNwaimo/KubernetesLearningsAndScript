Here is an example of a simple Pod object with two containers:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-with-sidecar
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:1.19
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
  - name: count
    image: busybox:1.34
    args: [/bin/sh, -c,
            'i=0; while true; do echo "$i: $(date)"; i=$((i+1)); sleep 1; done']



Note:
This command   [/bin/sh, -c,
            'i=0; while true; do echo "$i: $(date)"; i=$((i+1)); sleep 1; done'], 
is an infinite loop that prints the current date and time every second.

Breakdown:
- /bin/sh: Invokes the Bourne shell.
- -c: Specifies that the command is a string.
- The command string:
    - i=0: Initializes a counter variable i to 0.
    - while true; do: Starts an infinite loop.
    - echo "$i: $(date)": Prints the current value of i and the current date and time.
    - i=$((i+1)): Increments the counter i by 1.
    - sleep 1: Pauses the loop for 1 second.

Example Output:

0: Mon May 12 12:00:00 UTC 2025
1: Mon May 12 12:00:01 UTC 2025
2: Mon May 12 12:00:02 UTC 2025
...


This command is often used for testing or demonstration purposes.
